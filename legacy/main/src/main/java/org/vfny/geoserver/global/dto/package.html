<title>GeoServer Global DTO</title>
</head>

<body>

Maintains the Data Transfer Objects used to set up GeoServer.

<p>
Application set up is provided using Data Transfer Objects from this 
package. Both the initial loading the initial XML configuration files and the
dynamic configuraiton systems are handled using these objects.
</p>

<p>
The use of Data Transfer Objects allows the Global package to not depend on 
either the Persistence Method (some DataStore configuration infromation may
migrate from XML into the Database) or the Dyanmic Configuration System.
</p>
<p>
If GeoServer moved to a JXM scheme for management the DTO object will be used
"over the wire".
