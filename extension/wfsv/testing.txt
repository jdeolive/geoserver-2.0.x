Executing tests in this module
----------------------------------

This module needs a dedicated PostGIS database in order to run its
tests. If that's not available, the tests will be silently skipped
in order to avoid breaking the build.

To enable testing in this module:
* create a new empty PostGIS database (that is, load the PostGIS
  functions and srs list into it)
* create a .geoserver folder into your home directory
* create the $home/.geoserver/wfsv.properties file and adapt the
  contents to suit your database
  
dbtype=postgis
host=localhost
port=5432
database=versioningtst
schema=public
user=postgres
passwd=password
namespace=http://www.geoserver.org/versioning

* run again the tests in wfsv, you should notice them taking
  a lot more time than before. Also, if the tests are being skipped due
  to connection problems, you should see on the console messages such
  as: "Skipping testClassName.methodName since test data is not available"
