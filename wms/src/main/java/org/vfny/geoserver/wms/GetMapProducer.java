/**
 * Provides the skeleton for producers of map image, as required by the GetMap
 * WMS request.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A GetMapProducer implementation is meant to produce one and only one type of
 * content, whose normative MIME-Type is advertised through the
 * {@link #getContentType()} method. Yet, the {@link #getOutputFormat()} method
 * is meant to advertise the map format in the capabilities document and may or
 * may not match the mime type.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To incorporate a new producer specialized in a given output format, there
 * must be a {@linkplain org.vfny.geoserver.wms.responses.GetMapProducer}
 * registered in the spring context that can provide instances of that concrete
 * implementation.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The methods defined in this interface respect the general parse
 * request/produce response/get mime type/write content workflow, so they should
 * raise an exception if are called in the wrong order (which is produceMap ->
 * getContentType -> writeTo)
